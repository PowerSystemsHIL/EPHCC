Procedure to test the Relay (works for models with and without modbus)

1 - Start the simulation with the given settings. (Vs1 = 7947.5V @ 60Hz, Vs2 = Vs1, all contactors are software
controlled and open, except for MCB contactor, which is controlled by the relay. Enable is 1, op_mode, reset and
protection mode are 0). If by the start, with the correct settings, MCB opens, start the simulation with Enable equal to
0 and once it started change it back to 1.

2 - Start testing the protection modes of the relay.

	2.1 - Test instant over current protection R50 IOC. To check if it's working close the HSC contactor. The short circuit
level will cross the limit defined in the relay mask by "R50 IOC pickup" (the current here is referred to the secundary of the
current transformer). The relay has to open the contactor within "IOC time delay" + 1/4 of a 60Hz cycle. Once the relay opens,
it will remain open until Reset is set to 1 and the fault is cleared. Change Reset back to 0 once the relay reconnects.

	2.2 - Test time over current protection R51 TOC. To check if it's working close the LSC contactor. The short circuit level
will cross the limit defined in the relay mask by "R51 TOC pickup", but will not cross the IOC limit. The relay has to open according
to the trip curve. There are four types of curves that can be selected by "TOC curve type". All of them follow the equation:

		timeDelay = timeDial*(B+(A/(M^P-1)))

where, A, B and P are the parameters that change with the curve type selection, timeDial is set in the mask by "TOC time dial", and
M is the ratio between measured current and the current limit (all referred to the CT secundary). When:
		"TOC curve type" = 1 -> A = 0.0104, B = 0.0226 and P = 0.02;
		"TOC curve type" = 2 -> A = 5.95, B = 0.180 and P = 2;
		"TOC curve type" = 3 -> A = 3.88, B = 0.0923 and P = 2;
		"TOC curve type" = 4 -> A = 5.67, B = 0.0352 and P = 2;
The relay has to open within the time defined by timeDelay. Clear the fault and reset the relay. Check if the MCB is closed.

	2.3 - Test over voltage protection R59 OV. To check if it's working change VS1 voltage to 1.2 times the nominal value. The
relay has to open within 1/4 of a 60Hz cycle + "OV trip delay" that is defined in the relay mask. Change VS1 back to it's nominal 
value and reset the relay if needed. Check if MCB is closed.

	2.4 - Test under voltage protection R27 UV. To check if it's working change VS1 voltage to 0.8 times the nominal value. The
relay has to open within 1/4 of a 60Hz cycle + "UV trip delay" that is defined in the relay mask. Change VS1 back to it's nominal 
value and reset the relay if needed. Check if MCB is closed.

	2.5 - Test syncronism check protection R25. To check if it's working, cause an high short circuit to make the relay trip.
Once it is open, clear the fault and close the grid2 contactor. Change the Vs2 frequency to 61Hz and back to 60Hz. Reset the Relay.
You will be able to see in the scope that the phases between the grid side and the load side are not matching anymore.
The relay should never close under this condition. In fact, the relay will only close if voltage, frequency and phase are matching.
You can try changing any of those parameters to check if the relay will connect or not. Now change the Vs2 frequency to 60.01Hz and
wait for the phases to synch,once synched, move the frequency back to 60Hz. Synce now, phase, voltage and frequency are the same on
both sides of the relay, MCB should close.

3 - Few notes:
	when op_mode = 0, the MCB will only close when both sides of the contactor are in synch and there's no command to open from
the other protective functions.
	when op_mode = 1, the MCB will only close when both sides of the contactor are in synch. The other protective functions
will be disabled.
	when op_mode = 2, the MCB will receive a command to open and will stay open until op_mode is changed.

	when protection_mode = 0, the relay will use the Grid Tied parameters defined on the Grid Tied tab.
	when protection_mode = 1, the relay will use the Islanded parameters defined on the Islanded tab.
